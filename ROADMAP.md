# Emporia Vue Integration Roadmap

This roadmap provides an overview of the major risks in our current codebase and outlines refactoring opportunities that will improve code quality, maintainability, and performance. It is meant to guide our future work with clear milestones and actionable tasks.

---

## 1. Biggest Risks

- **Tight Coupling and Global State:**  
  - Many modules directly rely on shared globals (e.g., `DEVICE_GIDS`, `DEVICE_INFORMATION`, `LAST_MINUTE_DATA`), increasing the risk of unpredictable behavior.
  - The integration code in `__init__.py` intermixes authentication, API calls, and entity setup.

- **Synchronous Calls in an Asynchronous Context:**  
  - Numerous calls (e.g., `run_in_executor` with blocking functions and plain `time.sleep` in async loops) risk blocking the event loop, impacting responsiveness.
  - Mixing synchronous libraries (like `requests`) with async patterns makes it hard to control timeouts and retries properly.

- **Error Handling and Token Refresh Complexity:**  
  - The authentication and token management logic in `pyemvue/auth.py` and related code risks unexpected errors, potential race conditions, and manual state updates.
  - Retry logic for API calls (using blocking sleep) is fragile, making it hard to adjust for network instability.

- **Component-Specific Complexity:**  
  - The sensor, switch, and charger entity implementations are spread across multiple files with duplicated patterns. This duplication makes maintenance and debug challenging.
  - The logic for flattening channel usage and merging minute/daily updates is nontrivial and could hide subtle bugs.

## 2. Potential Refactoring Benefits

- **Improved Separation of Concerns:**  
  - Isolate API communication (HTTP calls, retries) from device and entity logic.  
  - Factor out globals into a proper service or “data manager” class that each integration can depend on.

- **Full Asynchronous Refactoring:**  
  - Replace blocking `requests` calls with an async HTTP client (e.g., `aiohttp`) to avoid blocking the event loop.  
  - Remove `time.sleep()` in favor of `asyncio.sleep()` in retry/ backoff logic.

- **Enhanced Error Handling & Resilience:**  
  - Centralize token management and error handling logic, reducing redundant refresh calls.  
  - Improve logging to capture scenarios where data is missing or inconsistent.

- **Better Modularity and Type Safety:**  
  - Refactor modules such as sensor, switch, and charger entities to share common base classes and helpers for entity naming, unique id generation, and device info.  
  - Adopt a more type-safe design (using Python’s type hints throughout) so that API responses and internal data structures are well validated.

- **Easier Testing and Future Extensions:**  
  - Decouple the core API layer (in `pyemvue/pyemvue.py`) from the Home Assistant-specific integration code.  
  - Refactor the “flattening” and integration of channel usage data into a library with clear inputs and outputs, making it easier to write unit tests.

## 3. Proposed Roadmap Phases

### Phase 1: Analysis & Preparation (1–2 weeks)
- **Audit Globals & Shared State:**  
  - Identify and document all uses of global state in `__init__.py` and related modules.
- **Investigate Asynchronous Patterns:**  
  - Evaluate all blocking calls used in async contexts, especially in API call wrappers.
- **Document Current Error Flows:**  
  - Map out the authentication/token refresh cycles and retry logic in `pyemvue/auth.py` and `pyemvue/pyemvue.py`.

---

### Phase 2: Core Refactoring (3–4 weeks)
- **Decouple API Communication:**  
  - Create a dedicated API client class that handles all HTTP calls. Migrate from `requests` to an async client (e.g., `aiohttp`).
- **Centralize Global State:**  
  - Refactor controller logic so that globals (like `DEVICE_INFORMATION`) are encapsulated in a single service class.
- **Replace Blocking Calls:**  
  - Substitute any `time.sleep()` with `await asyncio.sleep()` and revise retry loops accordingly.
- **Enhance Token Management:**  
  - Reorganize the authentication logic in a dedicated module/service, ensuring non-blocking, thread-safe token refresh.

---

### Phase 3: Component and Entity Enhancements (2–3 weeks)
- **Unify Sensor, Switch, and Charger Implementations:**  
  - Extract common logic (e.g., device naming, unique identifier generation) into shared utility functions or base classes.
- **Improve Data Processing Layers:**  
  - Refactor usage data “flattening” and merging logic into distinct, testable functions.
- **Strengthen Error Logging & Reporting:**  
  - Standardize error handling and logging across all components for better traceability.

---

### Phase 4: Testing, Documentation & Deployment (2–3 weeks)
- **Unit & Integration Tests:**  
  - Write tests covering API communication, token management, and device data processing.
- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Update developer documentation with the new structure, usage patterns, and guidelines.
- **Performance & Stress Testing:**  
  - Run tests to ensure that the asynchronous model improves performance and does not block HA’s event loop.
- **Deploy & Monitor:**  
  - Stage the release and monitor logs for early detection of any regressions.

---

## 4. Future Considerations

- **Automated Testing & CI/CD Pipelines:**  
  - Implement continuous integration that triggers unit tests for all new asynchronous code.
- **Long-Term Modularization:**  
  - Consider splitting the API client and device parsing logic into separate packages for reuse in other projects.
- **Community & Contributions:**  
  - Document the roadmap and invite community contributions to the refactoring process.  
  - Plan regular code reviews and refactoring sprints.

## Conclusion

Addressing these risks with deliberate, phased refactoring will significantly improve the maintainability, performance, and resilience of our integration. This roadmap is our commitment to delivering a robust, future-proof solution.
