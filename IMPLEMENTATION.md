1 Session 1: Audit and Documentation
• Conduct a detailed audit of the current type hints.
• Document missing or incomplete type hints.
• Save the results in TYPE_ROADMAP.md
2 Session 2: Type Alias Introduction
• Identify complex type annotations and introduce type aliases.  Type aliases should be used to simplify, do not use if they make things more complex.
• Refactor the code to use these type aliases.
3 Session 3: Enhance Type Annotations
• Add missing type annotations and replace Any with specific types.  Evaluate the type hints in this code critically as a senior staff engineer.
• Ensure consistent use of Optional and Self.
4 Session 4: Static Type Checking Integration
• Integrate mypy into the development workflow.
• Run mypy and address any issues identified.
5 Session 5: Refactoring and Consistency
• Refactor the code for consistent use of type hints.
• Ensure all public APIs are well-documented with type annotations.
6 Session 6: Training and Guidelines
• Provide training on type hinting best practices.
• Develop and distribute guidelines for type hint usage.
• Write a file named 'TYPE_GUIDELINES.md' with this information

Note: When implementing changes, ensure that previous work, such as type aliases, is not inadvertently removed. Always verify the current state of the codebase before making modifications.

By following this plan, you can achieve full type support in the codebase, leading to improved code quality and a better experience for external consumers of the library.
