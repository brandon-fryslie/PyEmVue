1 Session 1: Audit and Documentation
• Conduct a detailed audit of the current type hints.
• Document missing or incomplete type hints.
2 Session 2: Type Alias Introduction
• Identify complex type annotations and introduce type aliases.
• Refactor the code to use these type aliases.
3 Session 3: Enhance Type Annotations
• Add missing type annotations and replace Any with specific types.
• Ensure consistent use of Optional and Self.
4 Session 4: Static Type Checking Integration
• Integrate mypy into the development workflow.
• Run mypy and address any issues identified.
5 Session 5: Refactoring and Consistency
• Refactor the code for consistent use of type hints.
• Ensure all public APIs are well-documented with type annotations.
6 Session 6: Training and Guidelines
• Provide training on type hinting best practices.
• Develop and distribute guidelines for type hint usage.

By following this plan, you can achieve full type support in the codebase, leading to improved code quality and a better experience for external
consumers of the library.
